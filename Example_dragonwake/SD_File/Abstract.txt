This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card. 

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - PLL0   = 400 MHz
   - CCLK   = 100 MHz

   - USART1: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The SD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

MCB1700:  Standalone application for Keil MCB1700 Board using
          COM1 port as a communication interface.

          Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port using
