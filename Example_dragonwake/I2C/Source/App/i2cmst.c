  I2CReadLength, I2CWriteLength is 0, the read value will be filled 
  in the I2CMasterBuffer. 
  (3) If it's a I2C Write/Read with repeated start, specify the 
  I2CWriteLength, fill the content of bytes to be written in 
  I2CMasterBuffer, specify the I2CReadLength, after the repeated 
  start and the device address with RD bit set, the content of the 
  reading will be filled in I2CMasterBuffer index at 
  I2CMasterBuffer[I2CWriteLength+2].

  RDByte1...RDByteN Stop. The content of the reading will be filled
