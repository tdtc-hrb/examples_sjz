The Memory project is a demo program for the LPC1768
using Keil MCB1700 board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 400 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK = 100 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  25 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - LED0: LED_RD   is on when USB Device is performing Read access
  - LED1: LED_WR   is on when USB Device is performing Write access
  - LED2: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - LED3: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  MCB1700: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper D-, D+ to DEVICE
